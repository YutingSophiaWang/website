        <h3>Biography</h3>
      <p align="justify">I have embarked on my journey to explore the fascinating world of both engineering and computer science at an early age. Admiring the advanced electronics, informatics and mechatronics technology in Germany, I became competent in German and was admitted to University of Duisburg-Essen (UDE) in 2010. As an international student from China, it was difficult adjusting to living and studying in a new country. I was able to adapt though, and finished by graduating in Germany with highest honors.</p>
<p align="justify">Now I am an exchange master's student in Language Technologies Institute, School of Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon University. I am attending the InterACT Program, which is an exchange program between KIT and CMU, to write my Master’s thesis: Modular Deep Neural Networks (mDNN) with Improved Bottleneck Features and Residual Learning for Speech Recognition. I conduct this project under the co-supervision of Professor <a style=" text-decoration: none" href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~fmetze/interACT/Home.html">Florian Metze </a> at CMU and Professor <a style=" text-decoration: none" href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ahw/">Alexander Waibel </a> at KIT.</p>
<p align="justify">Studying as a master’s student at Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), the best university in computer science in Germany, I have discovered new concepts, like speech recognition, computer vision, robotics, human-computer interaction and machine learning, all of which appeal to me. Our modern society faces the challenge of turning massive raw data into latent useful information. I have devoted myself to better enable machines to perceive the world intelligently and effortlessly.</p>
<p align="justify">During my researches,  I have long meditated on life. I learned to understand and tolerate others. I have volunteered to work at my university’s psych-consultant hotline for two years. During this time, I kept providing advice to those who suffered from study, work and love. This was the most important lesson I was taught &mdash; help myself by helping others.
